# TV_Script_Generation

## Project Description

In this project, you'll generate your own **Seinfeld** TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
